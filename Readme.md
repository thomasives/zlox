# zlox 

A (incomplete) zig implementation of the bytecode virtual machine based intepreter for the lox language as described in [Bob Nystrom's Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/) web book.

This is an excerise in learning [the zig programming language](https://ziglang.org) and so the code here is probably terrible.

Using zig version 0.7.1.
